To get the link to the OSM object, you can try the following:

 * Go to [https://openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org).
 * Move to the area of the map where you expect the result and then zoom in as much as possible.
 * Click on the question mark on the right side of the map. You get a question cursor. Use it to click on the map where your object is located.
