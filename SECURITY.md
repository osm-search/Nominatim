## How we Disclose Security Issues

** The following section only applies to security issues found in released
versions. Issues that concern the master development branch only will be
fixed immediately on the branch with the corresponding PR containing the
description of the nature and severity of the issue. **

Patches for identified security issues are applied to all affected versions and
new minor versions are released. At the same time we release a statement at
the [Nominatim blog](https://nominatim.org/blog/) describing the nature of the
incident. Announcements will also be published at the
[geocoding mailinglist](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/geocoding).
