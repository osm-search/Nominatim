<h2>Welcome to Nominatim</h2>

<p>Nominatim is a search engine for <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
data. This is the debugging interface. You may search for a name or address(forward search) or
look up data by its geographic coordinate(reverse search). Each result comes with a
link to a details page where you can inspect what data about the object is saved in 
the database and investigate how the address of the object has been computed.</p>
