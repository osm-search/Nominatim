    Please ensure that you include a full description of the problem, including the search
    query that you used, the problem with the result and, if the problem relates to missing data,
    the osm type (node, way, relation) and id of the item that is missing.

    Problems that contain enough detail are likely to get looked at before ones that require
    significant research.
