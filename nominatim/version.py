#
# When adding a migration on the development branch, raise the patch level
# to 99 to make sure that the migration is applied when updating from a
# patch release to the next minor version. Patch releases usually shouldn't
# have migrations in them. When they are needed, then make sure that the
# migration can be reapplied and set the migration version to the appropriate
# patch level when cherry-picking the commit with the migration.

# Released versions always have a database patch level of 0.
