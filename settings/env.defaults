### Replication settings
#
# The following settings control where and how updates for the database are
# retrieved.
#

#
# Base URL of replication service.
# A replication service provides change files of OSM data at regular intervals.
# These are used to keep the database up to date. Per default it points to
# the minutely updates for the main OSM database. There are other services
# geared towards larger update intervals or data extracts.
# Changing this value requires to rerun 'nominatim replication --init'.

# Maximum amount of data to download per batch.
# Size is in MB.
NOMINATIM_REPLICATION_MAX_DIFF=50

# Publication interval of the replication service (in seconds).
# Determines when Nominatim will attempt again to download again a new
# update. The time is computed from the publication date of the last diff
# downloaded. Setting this to a slightly higher value than the actual
# publication interval avoids unnecessary rechecks.
NOMINATIM_REPLICATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=75

# Wait time to recheck for a pending update (in seconds).
# Time to wait after an expected update was not available on the server.
NOMINATIM_REPLICATION_RECHECK_INTERVAL=60

### API settings
#
# The following settings configure the API responses. You must rerun
# 'nominatim refresh --website' after changing any of them.

# Send permissive CORS access headers.
# When enabled, send CORS headers to allow access to everybody.

# URL for static icon images.
# Set this to the /mapicon directory of your nominatim-ui to enable returning
# icon URLs with the results.

# Language to assume when no particular language is requested.
# When unset, the local language (i.e. the name tag without suffix) will be used.

# Enable a special batch query mode.
# This feature is currently undocumented and potentially broken.
NOMINATIM_SEARCH_BATCH_MODE=no

# Threshold for searches by name only.
# Threshold where the lookup strategy in the database is switched. If there
# are less occurences of a tem than given, the search does the lookup only
# against the name, otherwise it uses indexes for name and address.
NOMINATIM_SEARCH_NAME_ONLY_THRESHOLD=500

# Maximum number of OSM ids accepted by /lookup.
NOMINATIM_LOOKUP_MAX_COUNT=50

# Number of different geometry formats that may be queried in parallel.
# Set to zero to disable polygon output.

### Log settings
#
# The following options allow to enable logging of API requests.
# You must rerun 'nominatim refresh --website' after changing any of them.
#
# Enable logging of requests into the DB.
# The request will be logged into the new_query_log table.
# You should set up a cron job that regularly clears out this table.

# Enable logging of requests into a file.
# To enable logging set this setting to the file to log to.
